Mini Php Project: Reverse Auction Site


A bid (on high tech products) has a start date and an end date.

A person connected to the site and possessing tokens (to be deinir) can propose an auction
on each item being auctioned.


The principle of reverse auctions is to come up with the lowest possible single bid.

At the end of the auction, the person who bid the single lowest bid wins the prize.
